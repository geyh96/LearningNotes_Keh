    ROBUST NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION WITH DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS
  \end{marginnotes}
}
Use Deep neural network do regression.
Main contributions lies in the theoretical part.
\begin{itemize}
  \item excess risk grows with d, the dimension of data in sublinear form
  \item only require that the Y has finite p order moment. it is the key point of the ROBUST in the title.
  \item loose the assumption of exact manifold suppurt assumption
  \item limitation: X have bounded support. The condition is needed in the approximation theory.
  The condition appears in page 10. (Writting skills.)
\end{itemize}

$f^0$ is the true function we want.
$Z= (X,Y)$ is random vector independent of $f$.  \Kchange{So no post selection problem here.? why emphisize it.}
$Y =  f^0(X) + \eta$, where $\eta$ is the noise vector independent with $X$.
$L$ is the loss function that is Lipschitz and continuous.


So we can define the risk we interested in :
$$
R(f) = E_z L\{f(x),Y\}
$$

and we define the target here is 
$f^* = \argmin_f R(f) = \argmin_f E_z L\{f(x),Y\}$

\Kchange{The target of optimization and what we optimize is in the same page with the definition of $f^*$}.

We denote $\mS = \{X_i,Y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is the data set with sample size $n$.

Then we can define the empirical risk on the data set is :
$$
R_n(f) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i L\{f(X_i),Y_i\}
$$
.

We define the estimated function as
$$
\hat f_n = \argmin\limits_{f\in \mF_n} R_n(f)
$$
The estimated function must be defined in a proper function class $\mF_n$. The subscripts $n$ says the depedency of the function class with the sample size $n$.

So we have the excess risk:
$$
R(\hat f_n) - R(f^*) = E_z L\{\hat f_n(X),Y\} - E_z L\{f^*(X),Y\}
$$
\Kchange{The excess risk is the key point in machine learning
We think a ``better'' $f_n$ should have smaller excess risk.
However, the excess risk is still unobeservable.
}

And recall that $\hat f_n$ depends on the data, so the definition above is actually random.
We can also investigate its expectation, $E_z\{R(\hat f_n) - R(f^*)\}$.

Then we describe the function class $\mF_n$,
