Key point: the trade-off between privacy protection and statistical accuracy


The key point of the paper to ensure statistical accuracy is from
distribution invariant privatization (DIP) method
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item many convergence rate $n^{-1/3}$
%   \item Key point is: continuous mapping theorem for the location of maximum point.
%   \item 
% \end{itemize}
